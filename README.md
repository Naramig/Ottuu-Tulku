# Ottuu Tulku (Firefox)

Ottuu Tulku (Firefox) is a Mozilla Common Voice hackathon project for children education in Kyrgyz language
It is an AR mobile app developed on Unity. We combined education and entertainment to involve children in the process of learning. First option of Ottuu Tulku is an AR fairytale with sound. We pregenerated voice for the fairytale, but the idea is to allow teachers to make small changes to the story, so you might want to use Common Voice to make it dynamic and generate voice on air. The educational part is a Kyrgyz language dictation test, the app is playing a voice recording, while student has to type it up on the screen. The Ottuu Tulku will notify him with a text message if he makes a mistake. 

When you choose "Jomok" option you will need to find trigger and then press a "Start" button in order for the animation to start. I've added this wonderful cartoon picture, which we used as a trigger. You don't have to print it, just open it on the screen. In case your phone will not be able to recognize it, just decrease brightness of your screen and it will work. You can find the picture below in repo as Trigger.jpg.

If you want to try it out, you will need: 
* Unity - https://unity.com/
* Vuforia - https://www.vuforia.com/
* Common Voice (Not necessary to launch the program, but you might want your own voice recordings) - voice.mozilla.org 
We recommend to use Unity 2018.3.5f1 or higher version to avoid incompatibility.
You will also have to get your own license key from Vuforia. 
A piece of documentation on that topic - https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/vuforia_get_started_project_setup
Also if you are having a hard time with setting up an Android build, here is documentation and a video tutorial for that:

We haven't tested this app for iOS, but you still can try it yourself:

# There is still so much to do

We have only done the least part of what we wanted to do. The Ottuu Tulku still does not have some key features implemented, but it still relies on Mozilla's voice tool kit. 
We can make it much better by donating our voice to the project. Common Voice still does not have enough data to make speech recognition algorithms for many languages, including Kyrgyz. You can find the list of languages and contribute to the project here <br>
